# Basic-C++
Basic interview programs in C++

This is a mini series of basic C++ problems asked in coding iterviews.
I'm building this up while preparing for my interview.
Try the problems first by yourself and seek this repository for reference.

The solutions might not be the best ones but will give you a direction to solve the problem.
